# 6.0 Migration at Scale via API (optional)

In this section, we will be looking at migrating multiple namespaces in a single Migration Plan.  In these types of large scale migrations, sometimes using the WebUI can be less than ideal.  With that, we are also going to use the API directly for creating and executing our migration.

## 6.1 Setup

Let's start by seeding our _source cluster_ with a set of sample stateless applications.  We've added a set of [scripts](./scripts/lab8/) to make this simple:

### 6.1.0 Deploy HelloOpenShift Apps

The `deploy.sh` script will deploy the HelloOpenShift application to a user specified number of namespaces.  For our purposes, let's choose 5.

```bash
$ ./deploy.sh
Number of namespaces?
5
namespace/hello-openshift-1 created
pod/hello-openshift created
service/hello-openshift exposed
route.route.openshift.io/hello-openshift exposed
namespace/hello-openshift-2 created
pod/hello-openshift created
service/hello-openshift exposed
route.route.openshift.io/hello-openshift exposed
namespace/hello-openshift-3 created
pod/hello-openshift created
service/hello-openshift exposed
route.route.openshift.io/hello-openshift exposed
namespace/hello-openshift-4 created
pod/hello-openshift created
service/hello-openshift exposed
route.route.openshift.io/hello-openshift exposed
namespace/hello-openshift-5 created
pod/hello-openshift created
service/hello-openshift exposed
route.route.openshift.io/hello-openshift exposed
Finding routes...
hello-openshift-hello-openshift-1.apps.db45.events.opentlc.com
hello-openshift-hello-openshift-2.apps.db45.events.opentlc.com
hello-openshift-hello-openshift-3.apps.db45.events.opentlc.com
hello-openshift-hello-openshift-4.apps.db45.events.opentlc.com
hello-openshift-hello-openshift-5.apps.db45.events.opentlc.com
```

### 6.1.1 Validate applications

We've also included a `probe.sh` script that will verify that all deployed applications are responding.

```bash
$ ./probe.sh
Probing app in namespace hello-openshift-1
Hello OpenShift!
Probing app in namespace hello-openshift-2
Hello OpenShift!
Probing app in namespace hello-openshift-3
Hello OpenShift!
Probing app in namespace hello-openshift-4
Hello OpenShift!
Probing app in namespace hello-openshift-5
Hello OpenShift!
```

Great!  We are now ready to assemble our Migration Plan.

## 6.2 Create Migration Plan

Since we've already performed successful migrations throughout the preceding labs, we already have our MigCluster, Cluster, & MigStorage resources created. This means we are ready to assemble our MigPlan.

In the below yaml, we've seeded with the created resources.  Copy the below as a starting point into your favorite editor:

```yaml
apiVersion: migration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MigPlan
metadata:
  labels:
    controller-tools.k8s.io: "1.0"
  name: multi-namespace-migplan
  namespace:  mig
spec:

  srcMigClusterRef:
    name: ocp3
    namespace: mig

  destMigClusterRef:
    name: host
    namespace: mig

  migStorageRef:
    name: myrepo
    namespace: mig

  # [!] Change namespaces to adjust which OpenShift namespaces should be migrated from source to destination cluster
  namespaces:
  -
```

Next, let's add the desired namespaces:

* hello-openshift-1
* hello-openshift-2
* hello-openshift-3
* hello-openshift-4
* hello-openshift-5

Save the file as `mig-plan.yaml`

```bash
# Creates MigPlan 'multi-namespace-migplan' in namespace 'mig'
$ oc apply -f mig-plan.yaml
migplan.migration.openshift.io/multi-namespace-migplan created
```

Let's Describe our MigPlan. Assuming the controller is running, validations should have run against the plan, and you should be able to see a status of **"The migration plan is ready."** or a list of issues to resolve.

```
$ oc describe migplan multi-namespace-migplan  -n mig
Name:         multi-namespace-migplan
Namespace:    mig

```

## 6.3 Execute migration

Let's now proceed with creating a `MigMigration` that will execute our Migration Plan. Again, in the below yaml, we've seeded with the created resources.  Copy the below as a starting point into your favorite editor:

```yaml
apiVersion: migration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: MigMigration
metadata:
  labels:
    controller-tools.k8s.io: "1.0"
  name: migmigration-multi-namespace
  namespace: mig
spec:
  # [!] Set 'stage: true' to run a 'Stage Migration' and skip quiescing of Pods on the source cluster.
  stage: false
  # [!] Set 'quiescePods: true' to scale down Pods on the source cluster after the 'Backup' stage of a migration has finished
  quiescePods: false

  migPlanRef:
    name: multi-namespace-migplan
    namespace: mig
```


Set the appropriate values for `stage` and `quiescePods`.  In this case, false and true respectively.  Save the file as `mig-migration.yaml`.

```bash
# Creates MigMigration 'migmigration-multi-namespace' in namespace 'mig'
$ oc apply -f mig-migration.yaml
migmigration.migration.openshift.io/migmigration-multi-namespace created
```

Monitor progress of the migration with `oc describe`. You should see a status of **"The migration is ready."**, otherwise you'll see an error condition within `oc describe` output indicating what action you need to take before the migration can begin.

```bash
$ oc describe migmigration -n mig migmigration-sample
Name:         migmigration-sample
Namespace:    migration
API Version:  migration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
Kind:         MigMigration
Spec:
  Mig Plan Ref:
    Name:       migplan-sample
    Namespace:  migration
  Stage:        false
Status:
  Completion Timestamp:  2019-05-22T21:46:09Z
  Conditions:
    Category:              Required
    Last Transition Time:  2019-05-24T14:50:06Z
    Message:               The migration is ready.
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
  Migration Completed:     true
  Start Timestamp:         2019-05-22T21:43:27Z
  Task Phase:              Completed
Events:                    <none>
```
Notice how the MigMigration shown above has 'Task Phase': Completed. This means that the migration is complete, and we should be able to verify our apps existence on the destination cluster. You can continuously describe the MigMigration to see phase info, or tail the mig-controller logs with `oc logs -f <pod-name>`.

## 6.4 Verification

Let's login to our 4.1 cluster and run the `probe.sh` script to verify that the applications have been migrated and are running:

```bash
$ ./probe.sh
Probing app in namespace hello-openshift-1
Hello OpenShift!
Probing app in namespace hello-openshift-2
Hello OpenShift!
Probing app in namespace hello-openshift-3
Hello OpenShift!
Probing app in namespace hello-openshift-4
Hello OpenShift!
Probing app in namespace hello-openshift-5
Hello OpenShift!
```
